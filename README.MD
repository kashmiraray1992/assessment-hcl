# Calculator Exercise

The objective of this assessment is to have a "SimpleCalculator" that can perform single calculations and aggregated calculations based on a list of input objects.


## The brief

The objective of this assessment is to have a "SimpleCalculator" that can perform single calculations and calculations based on a list of input objects.

The "SimpleCalculator" will have the following operations:
•public double add(int, int)
•public double substract(int, int)
•public double multiply(int, int)
•public double divide(int, int)
•public List calculate(MultipleCalculationInputs)

The first four methods are single calculations. The last method returns a list of "Double" objects as a result of single calculation, based on the input objects "MultipleCalculationInputs" provided by the "MultipleCalculationInputsProvider". The "SimpleCalculatorInput" class and "MultiplCalculationInputs" interface are given and should be used.

The first two methods and the last one are Must haves and the others are Nice to haves.

## Guidelines
•Use Test Driven Development to build the "SimpleCalculator"
•Use the Eclipse/Intellij IDE in combination with the Maven build automation tool
•Use Java7/8 and coding standards (only JavaDoc for most important parts)
•Use JUnit 4.x and Mocking where needed
•Showing the functionality using JUnit tests is good enough (no main required)
•Keep it Simple

## Expected Deliverables

The Eclipse/Intellij project containing the pom-file, the code and tests. 


## Some hints
If you are new to Gradle, it may be worth spending 10 minutes reading a high level summary.  We are using the Gradle
Wrapper so `gradlew` from the command line should download everything you need.  Most modern IDEs support Gradle projects.
